/*Important Notes
*Always make the name of the variables indicate their name.
*  \n can be used instead of println
* val ==> "Variable only to read"
* var ==> "Adjustable variable"
* in some cases , you need to identified type variable , like | val department : String = "Computer S Engineer"
* That is, it has "must" to be a String value and so on.
* In some cases, we need a variable definition and give it value ,But you must specify the type of the variable , like | val job:String
*  */
